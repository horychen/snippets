http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/16172/should-i-always-use-a-comma-after-e-g-or-i-e
The distinction probably emerges from their different meanings in Latin, which grants them different usages in writing.
E.g. (exempli gratia in Latin, meaning “for example”) should be generally followed by a list of examples. Thus, adhering to proper English style usually requires commas to follow e.g. to delimit the beginning of that list.
I.e. (id est in Latin, meaning “that is”) is used to recapture the meaning of an antecedent clause by rephrasing. Typically, it is only followed by a clause describing a singular entity, and so does not require a comma.

This paper is organized as follows. The IM model and control
problem formulation are given in Section II. The proposed
solution is presented in Section III. In Section IV, the stability
analysis and the proposed flux selection algorithm are reported.
Details on the stability proof based on the singular perturbation
technique are given in Appendixes I and II. In Section V, results
of simulation and experimental tests are reported. Finally,
Section VI draws conclusions.
